# Transform-CSV's-data-into-TSV-Version
# In Notebooklm's answer, CSV version always 2 type which is including 縦 or 横 version.
## 縦 version is like:
<br>Asset total:
1. n/a
2. n/a

Transaction total:
1. n/a
2. n/a
## 横 version is like:
<br>Asset total:
1. n/a 2. n/a

Transaction total:
1. n/a 2. n/a

The result all showed TSV version : n/a  n/a ( which can copy and paste in Excel directly)
